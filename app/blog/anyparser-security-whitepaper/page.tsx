      <BlogSectionTitle title="Executive Summary" />
      <BlogParagraph>
        AnyParser On-prem is a cutting-edge document parsing solution designed to meet the stringent security
        requirements of modern enterprises. This whitepaper outlines the robust security measures implemented in
        AnyParser On-prem, ensuring data privacy, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency.
      </BlogParagraph>

      <BlogSectionTitle title="1. Introduction" />
      <BlogParagraph>
        In today&apos;s data-driven business landscape, efficient document parsing is crucial for streamlining
        operations and decision-making processes. However, the use of cloud-based language models for parsing sensitive
        documents introduces significant data privacy risks. AnyParser On-prem addresses these challenges by providing a
        secure, on-premises solution that leverages the power of advanced language models while maintaining complete
        control over sensitive data.

      <BlogSectionTitle title="Why CambioML AnyParser Stands Out: Speed and Accuracy" secondary />
      <BlogParagraph>
        The CambioML model excels in both speed and accuracy, striking the ideal balance for many business needs.
        It&apos;s faster than most large proprietary models while providing higher accuracy compared to traditional
        Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems. This means your business can achieve the best of both worldsâ€”quick,
        reliable document parsing without sacrificing performance.
      </BlogParagraph>

      <BlogParagraph>
        The graph above compares the throughput and accuracy of different document parsing models.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogList
        items={[
          {
            content:
              'X-axis (Horizontal): Represents the "Average Throughput (tokens/s)". This measures how quickly each model can process text, with higher values indicating faster processing speeds.',
          },
          {
            content:
              'Y-axis (Vertical): Represents "Accuracy". This measures how correctly each model interprets and extracts information from documents, with higher values indicating better performance.',
          },
        ]}
      />
      <BlogParagraph>
        Anyparser outperforms other models in both accuracy (about 0.82) and throughput (around 160 tokens/s), offering
        an optimal balance for enterprise document parsing needs.
      </BlogParagraph>

      <BlogSectionTitle title="2. Security Architecture Overview" />
      <BlogParagraph>
        AnyParser On-prem is designed with a security-first approach, offering an entire stack from the model itself to
        the serving infrastructure. This comprehensive solution can be seamlessly provisioned into private cloud
        environments such as AWS, GCP, and Azure.
      </BlogParagraph>

      <BlogSectionTitle title="2.1 Deployment Model" secondary />
      <BlogParagraph>
        The on-premises deployment model ensures that all data processing occurs within the organization&apos;s private
        environment. This approach eliminates the need to transmit sensitive documents outside the company&apos;s
        control, addressing concerns related to data sovereignty and regulatory compliance.

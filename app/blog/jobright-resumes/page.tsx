      <BlogSectionTitle title="Jobright.ai's Ask for Accurate Resume Parsing" />
      <BlogParagraph>
        As the leading AI-powered job marketplace, Jobright.ai faced a critical challenge in processing millions of
        resumes annually. The company recognized that accurate data extraction from resumes was crucial for user
        retention and overall service quality. This need for precision in document parsing and unstructured data
        processing became a top priority.

      <BlogSectionTitle title="Challenges with Traditional Parsing Methods" secondary />
      <BlogParagraph>
        Traditional OCR models can&apos;t capture semantic information from resumes, often struggle with accuracy in
        diverse document formats. These limitations frequently resulted in missed crucial details, potentially impacting
        the quality of matches between job seekers and employers. Jobright.ai needed a solution that could overcome
        these hurdles and provide superior parsing capabilities.
      </BlogParagraph>

      <BlogSectionTitle title="The Limitations of Traditional Document Extraction Methods" />
      <BlogParagraph>
        Traditional methods of document parsing and unstructured data extraction face significant challenges in
        today&apos;s digital landscape. These approaches, while once effective, now struggle to keep pace with the
        evolving complexity of modern documents.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogSectionTitle title="Inflexibility and Rule Dependence" secondary />
      <BlogParagraph>
        Traditional extraction methods often rely on predefined rules and templates, making them inflexible when
        confronted with varying document structures. This rigidity leads to frequent maintenance and updates, hampering
        efficiency and scalability.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogSectionTitle title="Contextual Understanding Deficits" secondary />
      <BlogParagraph>
        One of the most glaring limitations is the inability to comprehend context. OCR-based systems struggle with
        complex layouts, multi-column PDFs, and free-form text, often missing crucial details or misinterpreting
        information.
      </BlogParagraph>

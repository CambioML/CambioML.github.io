      <BlogSectionTitle title="FAQs on Extracting Tables from PDF Using Vision Language Models" />
      <BlogSectionTitle title="How does VLM-based extraction compare to traditional OCR methods?" />
      <BlogParagraph>
        Vision Language Models (VLMs) provide notable enhancements over traditional OCR for extracting tables from PDFs.
        Unlike OCR, VLMs accurately decipher intricate layouts, grasp contextual nuances, and manage multiple languages
        with ease.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogSectionTitle title="Which document types are best suited for VLM extraction?" />
      <BlogParagraph>
        VLMs are particularly adept at handling structured documents that contain tables, charts, and mixed-content
        elements. VLM-based tools can preserve table structures and extract data accurately from low-quality scans or
        documents with complex multilingual content.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogSectionTitle title="Is VLM-based extraction more accurate than manual data entry?" />
      <BlogParagraph>
        Yes, VLM-based solutions like AnyParser significantly outperform manual data entry or traditional OCR in terms
        of accuracy. These tools leverage both visual and contextual intelligence, potentially reducing conversion
        errors by up to 50% when moving from PDF to Excel or Google Sheets.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogSectionTitle title="Can VLMs process file formats other than PDFs?" />
      <BlogParagraph>
        Absolutely, advanced VLM-based tools are not limited to PDFs. They are capable of extracting data from a variety
        of formats, including images, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and scanned documents.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogSectionTitle title="Conclusion" />

      <BlogSectionTitle title="How OCR Invoice Scanning Software Works and what is the downside" />
      <BlogParagraph>
        Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology transforms static images into editable, searchable text. While
        OCR Invoice Scanning has revolutionized billing workflows, it&apos;s crucial to understand its limitations.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogSectionTitle title="The OCR Process" secondary />
      <BlogParagraph>
        OCR invoice scanning software analyzes the visual patterns of characters in an image, matching them against
        known letter shapes and fonts. For invoices, it identifies key fields like dates, amounts, and vendor
        information. The software then converts these recognized patterns into machine-readable text.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogSectionTitle title="Limitations of Using OCR for scanning invoices" secondary />
      <BlogParagraph>Despite its advantages, OCR isn&apos;t infallible:</BlogParagraph>

      <BlogSectionTitle title="Advantages of VLM over OCR" />
      <BlogSectionTitle title="Enhanced Accuracy and Contextual Understanding" secondary />
      <BlogParagraph>
        Vision Language Models (VLMs) represent a significant leap forward in invoice scanning and document processing
        technology. Unlike traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems, VLMs can understand the context and
        relationships between different elements on an invoice. This allows for more accurate extraction of critical
        information such as invoice numbers, dates, and line items, even when dealing with complex or non-standard
        invoice layouts.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogSectionTitle title="Improved Handling of Visual Elements" secondary />
      <BlogParagraph>
        VLMs excel at interpreting visual information beyond just text. They can recognize logos, stamps, and
        signatures, providing a more comprehensive analysis of invoices. This capability is particularly valuable when
        processing bank statements, as VLMs can accurately identify and categorize transaction types based on visual
        cues and contextual information.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogSectionTitle title="Adaptability and Learning Capabilities" secondary />
      <BlogParagraph>
        One of the key advantages of VLMs in AnyParser&apos;s PNG to text converter is their ability to learn and adapt.
        Unlike rigid OCR systems, VLMs can be trained on diverse datasets, allowing them to handle a wide range of
        invoice formats and languages. This adaptability makes VLMs particularly effective for businesses dealing with
        international suppliers or varying invoice styles.

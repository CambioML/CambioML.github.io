      <BlogSectionTitle title="How Vision Language Models Work to Overcome OCR Challenges" />
      <BlogParagraph>
        Vision Language Models (VLMs) are revolutionizing the way we convert pdf to csv and transform complex documents
        into machine-readable formats. Unlike traditional OCR, VLMs leverage both visual and linguistic understanding to
        tackle the most challenging aspects of document conversion.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogSectionTitle title="Interpreting Complex Layouts" secondary />
      <BlogParagraph>
        VLMs excel at deciphering intricate document structures, making them ideal for converting word to excel or
        handling bank statements with varied formats. By analyzing the spatial relationships between text elements, VLMs
        can accurately reconstruct tables and preserve layout integrity. For example, VLMs can correctly interpret a PDF
        with an invoice containing multiple tables with different number of columns and rows, while conventional OCR
        will mess up the rows and columns.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogSectionTitle title="Contextual Understanding" secondary />
      <BlogParagraph>
        One of the key advantages of VLMs is their ability to grasp the semantic meaning of document content. This
        contextual awareness enables more accurate extraction when using a pdf to csv converter, especially for
        domain-specific documents like medical CBC reports or logistics shipping orders. For instance, VLMs can
        correctly classify medical reports by specialty based on their content, even understand “leukocyte” count is
        “white blood cells (WBCs)” count!
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogSectionTitle title="Multilingual Capability" secondary />
      <BlogParagraph>
        VLMs break down language barriers by seamlessly handling multiple scripts and languages within a single
        document. This makes them particularly useful for international businesses dealing with diverse document types.
        For example, VLMs can extract data from a PDF containing text in both English and French.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogSectionTitle title="Noise Reduction" secondary />
      <BlogParagraph>
        Low-quality scans or images often pose challenges for traditional OCR systems. VLMs, however, can effectively
        filter out noise and focus on relevant information, ensuring high-quality output when converting documents to
        Google Sheets or other formats. For example, VLMs can accurately extract data from a blurred or faded PDF
        document.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogSectionTitle title="FAQs on convert PDF to CSV Using Vision Language Models" />

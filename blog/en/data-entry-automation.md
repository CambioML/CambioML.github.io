The logistics industry is a cornerstone of the global economy, accounting for approximately 12% of the world's GDP. Despite its importance, the sector has been slow to adopt new technologies, with a significant portion of logistics companies still relying on manual processes. However, the tide is turning as companies recognize the benefits of data entry automation in logistics. In this blog post, we will explore the transformative impact of automation on logistics data entry and how it is being implemented across the industry.

## The Need for Data Entry Automation in Logistics

Manual data entry remains a prevalent practice in logistics, with a substantial number of companies still relying on it for over half of their processes. This approach is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error, which can lead to inefficiencies and increased costs. As supply chains grow more complex and customer expectations rise, manual data entry processes are becoming increasingly burdensome and error-prone. You need a solution that can keep up with the ever-increasing volume of information flowing through your operations.

### Challenges in Logistics Data Entry

1. **Volume of Documents**: Logistics companies handle a vast array of documents daily, including contracts, freight bills, bills of lading, and more. Your staff may spend hours inputting shipping details, inventory levels, and tracking information, taking valuable time away from more strategic tasks.

2. **Variability**: Each customer may have unique documentation formats, making standardization difficult. Moreover, even small mistakes can lead to significant disruptions in your supply chain.

3. **Accuracy and Speed**: The supply chain demands precise and rapid data processing for timely deliveries. Manual data entry is time-consuming, costly, and susceptible to human error.

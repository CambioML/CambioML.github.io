## How OCR Invoice Scanning Software Works and what is the downside

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology transforms static images into editable, searchable text. While OCR Invoice Scanning has revolutionized billing workflows, it's crucial to understand its limitations.

### The OCR Process

OCR invoice scanning software analyzes the visual patterns of characters in an image, matching them against known letter shapes and fonts. For invoices, it identifies key fields like dates, amounts, and vendor information. The software then converts these recognized patterns into machine-readable text.

### Limitations of Using OCR for scanning invoices

Despite its advantages, OCR isn't infallible:

- **Accuracy Issues**: Poor image quality, unusual fonts, or handwritten text can lead to recognition errors in scanning invoices.

- **Layout Challenges**: Non-standard invoice formats may confuse the software, resulting in misplaced or misinterpreted data.

- **Language Barriers**: Multi-language invoices can pose difficulties for OCR systems not optimized for diverse character sets when scanning invoices.

- **Complex Layouts**: OCR struggles with documents that have complex layouts or varied fonts, leading to inaccuracies in data capture.

- **Lack of Contextual Understanding**: OCR systems do not understand the context of the text they process, which can result in misinterpretations, especially with ambiguous characters or industry-specific terminology.

Similar limitations apply when using OCR to convert bank statement to excel. The technology may falter with intricate document layouts or mixed languages, leading to errors in financial data extraction.

## Advantages of VLM over OCR

### Enhanced Accuracy and Contextual Understanding

Vision Language Models (VLMs) represent a significant leap forward in invoice scanning and document processing technology. Unlike traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems, VLMs can understand the context and relationships between different elements on an invoice. This allows for more accurate extraction of critical information such as invoice numbers, dates, and line items, even when dealing with complex or non-standard invoice layouts.

### Improved Handling of Visual Elements

VLMs excel at interpreting visual information beyond just text. They can recognize logos, stamps, and signatures, providing a more comprehensive analysis of invoices. This capability is particularly valuable when processing bank statements, as VLMs can accurately identify and categorize transaction types based on visual cues and contextual information.

### Adaptability and Learning Capabilities

One of the key advantages of VLMs in AnyParser's PNG to text converter is their ability to learn and adapt. Unlike rigid OCR systems, VLMs can be trained on diverse datasets, allowing them to handle a wide range of invoice formats and languages. This adaptability makes VLMs particularly effective for businesses dealing with international suppliers or varying invoice styles.

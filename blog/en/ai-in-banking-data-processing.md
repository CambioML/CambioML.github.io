## How Intelligent Document Parsing Works

Intelligent Document Parsing (IDP) leverages advanced AI technologies to extract and understand information from documents with speed and precision. Here's how it works:

- **Document Ingestion**: IDP tools accept documents in various formats, such as scanned PDFs (such as pdf bank statement), images, emails, and digital forms, including bank statements and reconciliation documents.

- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: For scanned or image-based documents, OCR technology identifies and converts text into machine-readable data. Advanced OCR solutions can handle low-quality scans, handwritten notes, and complex layouts found in bank statements.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: NLP is used to interpret text contextually, recognizing entities (e.g., account numbers, transaction amounts) and relationships between them. This is especially useful for creating a bank reconciliation statement, where transaction matches must be identified accurately.

- **Vision Language Models (VLMs)**: These advanced AI systems integrate visual and textual data, enabling deeper contextual understanding of documents. For example, they can distinguish headers, tables, and footnotes in a bank statement to ensure comprehensive data extraction.

- **Data Structuring**: Extracted information is structured into a format compatible with the bank's data systems, ensuring seamless integration into downstream ETL processes.

- **Validation and Verification**: Automated checks ensure data accuracy, flagging inconsistencies for review.

By incorporating technologies like VLMs, IDP transforms traditional document processing, making it more efficient and reliable for banking tasks, including ETL and reconciliation processes.

## What Is Structured Data and Unstructured Data

In the digital information era, data is generated at any time, and enterprises create value through the analysis and processing of data. Therefore, collecting and recording data and processing and analyzing data have become two important tasks in business operation. In the process of data collection, unstructured data are encountered more often, the source and form of these data are diverse, and it is difficult to be classified or searched simply. Effective data ingestion is essential for organizations to efficiently transform raw data into actionable insights. In the process of data processing, the more encountered is structured data, which has a clear structure, well-defined information, and can be easily organized, searched and analyzed. Therefore, transforming unstructured data into structured data is an important step for enterprises to utilize the value of data.

### Structured Data

Structured data is data that fits into a predefined data model or schema. It is particularly useful for dealing with discrete, numeric data such as financial operations, sales and marketing figures, and scientific modeling.

Structured data is typically quantitative and organized in a way that makes it easily searchable. It includes common types like names, addresses, credit card numbers, telephone numbers, star ratings, bank information, and other data that can be easily queried using SQL in relational databases.

Examples of structured data in real-world applications include flight and reservation data when booking a flight, and customer behavior and preferences in CRM systems like Salesforce. It is best for associated collections of discrete, short, noncontinuous numerical and text values and is used for inventory control, CRM systems, and ERP systems.

Structured data is stored in relational databases, graph databases, spatial databases, OLAP cubes, and more. Its biggest benefit is that it is easier to organize, clean, search, and analyze, but the main challenge is that all data must fit into the prescribed data model.

### Unstructured Data

Unstructured data is data without an underlying model to discern attributes. It is used when the data won't fit into a structured data format, such as video monitoring, company documents, and social media posts.

Examples of unstructured data includes a variety of formats such as emails, images, video files, audio files, social media posts, PDFs, and more. Approximately 80-90% of data is unstructured, which means it has huge potential for competitive advantage if companies can leverage it.

Examples of unstructured data in real-world applications include chatbots performing text analysis to answer customer questions and provide information, and data used to predict changes in the stock market for investment decisions. Unstructured data is best for associated collections of data, objects, or files where the attributes change or are unknown, and it is used with presentation or word processing software and tools for viewing or editing media. Unstructured supplementary service data, such as social media posts and customer feedback, can provide valuable insights when converted into structured formats.

It is typically stored in data lakes, NoSQL databases, data warehouses, and applications. The biggest benefit of unstructured data is its ability to analyze data that can't be easily shaped into structured data, but the main challenge is that it can be difficult to analyze. The main analysis technique for unstructured data varies depending on the context and the tools used.

## Difference between structured and unstructured data

### Advantages of Structured Data and Disadvantages of Unstructured Data

Structured data offers the advantage of being easily searchable and used for machine learning algorithms, making it accessible to businesses and organizations for interpreting data. There are also more tools available for analyzing structured data than unstructured data. On the other hand, unstructured data requires data scientists to have expertise in preparing and analyzing the data, which could restrict other employees in the organization from accessing it. Additionally, special tools are needed to deal with unstructured data, further contributing to its lack of accessibility.

### Structured Data Analytics vs. Unstructured Data Analytics

Structured data analytics is typically more straightforward because the data is strictly formatted, allowing the use of programming logic to search for and locate specific data entries, as well as to create, delete, or edit entries. This makes automating data management and analysis of structured data more efficient. In contrast, unstructured data analytics does not have predefined attributes, making it more difficult to search and organize. Unstructured data analytics often requires complex algorithms to preprocess, manipulate, and analyze, posing a greater challenge in the analysis process. The analysis of unstructured supplementary service data often requires advanced parsing techniques to extract meaningful information.

### Structured Data Management vs. Unstructured Data Management

The management of structured data is generally more efficient due to its organized and predictable nature. Computers, data structures, and programming languages can more easily understand structured data, leading to minimal challenges in its use. Conversely, unstructured data management presents two significant challenges: storage, as unstructured data management is typically facing larger processing than structured data management, and analysis, as unstructured data management is not as straightforward as analyzing of structured data managements. To understand and manage unstructured data, computer systems must first break it down into understandable components, which is a more complex process.

### Summary of Difference between Structured and Unstructured Data

Structured data is defined and searchable, including data like dates, phone numbers, and product SKUs. This makes it easier to organize, clean, search, and analyze compared to unstructured data, which encompasses everything else that is more difficult to categorize or search, such as photos, videos, podcasts, social media posts, and emails. One sentence to explain the difference between structured and unstructured data: Most of the data in the world is unstructured, but structured data's ease of management and analysis gives it a significant edge in applications where data can be neatly organized and quickly accessed.

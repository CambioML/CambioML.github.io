===================================

Using uniflow, one may easily:

- Extract and split from unstructured text including
    - PDFs
    - HTML
    - Images
    - Markdown
- Transform content into structured data, e.g. create questions and answers from text
- Rate and compare the quality of the data

Our goal is to close the gap between active learning and data collection. We make
it easy to produce structured data for your own models, so you can use that data to finetune your models.
